***From Head of Data to open-source Data-Product builder***

As Head of Data at Nickel, I scaled data-organization from 3 to 200+ data-practitioners. 

My vision is to give data-power to data-analysts by making them autonomous on the whole data-chain: from data-collection to data-algorithm-deployments<br>
👉 *we build data products for that*. 

I created **Unytics** to go further as a personal project<br>
👉 *to provide open-source data products to the worldwide data-community.* 🚀
