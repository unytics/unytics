### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am [Paul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-marcombes/) an open-source data-products builder. 



***From Head of Data to open-source data-products builder***

As Head of Data at Nickel, I scaled data-organization from 3 to 100+ data-practitioners. 

My vision is to give data-power to business/product teams by making any data-analyst autonomous on the whole data-chain: from data-collection to data-algorithm-deployments. We build data products / tools for that. 

I created **Unytics** to go further: provide open-source data tools / products to the worldwide data-community. 

Products built so far are:

- âš¡ **bigfunctions**: Supercharge BigQuery with open-source curated functions. 
- âš¡ **simple_airbyte**: Simplify Airbyte Management via a lightweigth CLI and config files (no UI, no kubernetes cluster to manage, no database)
